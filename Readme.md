> 

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ng2-meanstack using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ng2-meanstack
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo ng2-meanstack
```
## What's unique in it?

If you use conventinal methods, your whole code is exposed in Angular 2 servers.

The server in this generator, prevents the user from accessing the backend code of your application, 
leaving them to be able to see only Angular 2 code rather then exposing whole server configurations and values.
*Any suggestions for improvement are welcomed anytime!*
